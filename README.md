# Intro: Object Orientation

Hallo!

Object orientation is one of the most powerful concepts in programming, and today that power will be yours. You'll learn about how we can create 'blueprints' (known as *classes*) which build objects that mirror or model real world objects, relationships, and environments. Ever wonder how Facebook can have over one billion users, or how a video game can have hundreds of detailed characters? The answer is through object orientation.

By the end of this class you will be able to use and explain the function of objects to model real-life structures.
