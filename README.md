Nearly _everything_ in Ruby is an object. What exactly is an object, though? An object is a programming construct comprised of attributes and actions. Its attributes are its data, and its actions are its methods. Take the string "popcorn". It's an object with a `length` method and length attribute of of 7. It has other methods you've seen before like `reverse` and `upcase`. In this lesson, you'll learn about how to create 'blueprints' (known as **classes**), which allow us to build Ruby objects modeled after real world systems and relationships. Ever wonder how Facebook can have over one billion users, or how a video game can have hundreds of detailed characters? The answer is object orientation.
